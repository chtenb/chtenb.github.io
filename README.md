# Setup

```
npm run restore
npm run build
npm run serve
```

For some reason, parcel does not pick up changes made to css. You have to retrigger a parcel build by modifying html, then restart parcel.

For the markdown files to build run:
./build.nu

Serving localhost doesn't seem to work for the markdown blogs, probably because parcell sucks.
